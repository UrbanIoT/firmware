  HM-3300/3600 is a new generation of laser dust detection sensor developed by our
  company, used for continuous and real-time detection of dust in the air.
  Different from the pumping dust detection sensor, the HM-3300/3600 innovatively uses fan
  blades to drive air, and the air flowing through the detection chamber is used as a test sample to
  perform real-time and continuous test on dust of different particle sizes in the air.
  HM-3300/3600 is suitable for dust detectors, intelligent air purifiers, intelligent air
  conditioners, intelligent ventilation fans, air quality testing, haze meters, environmental monitoring
  and relative products and applications.
